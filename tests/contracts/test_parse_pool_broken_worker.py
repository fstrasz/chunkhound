"""Contract tests: a parse worker that dies does not leave indexing stuck.

Observed on Windows: parse-pool workers died at start-up (an OSError releasing
their call-queue semaphore), the executor became broken, and the start-up
scan failed with BrokenProcessPool. The broken executor stayed the shared
pool, so every later parse in the process failed at once, and the failure
reached the server as a string, so nothing could tell it apart from a
permanent error.

These tests break the pool deterministically with a worker whose initializer
exits at once, which is how the observed workers died: before running a task.
